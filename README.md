# Snake-Game
Experience the nostalgia of the classic Snake game brought to life in Python! Dive into this engaging game where you control a hungry snake that must navigate a grid to eat food and grow longer. As you devour the food, your snake will increase in length, making the game more challenging as you avoid running into the walls or yourself.

Features:
- User-friendly controls: Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to guide the snake's movement.
- Appetizing food: The snake must gobble up the food that appear randomly on the grid.
- Growing challenge: With each food unit consumed, the snake grows longer, making maneuvering more intricate.
- Boundary awareness: Avoid hitting the walls of the grid, as it will end the game.
- Tail management: Be cautious not to collide with your snake's own tail, which will also lead to a game over.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as it increases with each food item eaten.
- High score competition: Challenge yourself to beat your previous best score and become the ultimate Snake master.
